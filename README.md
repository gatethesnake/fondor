The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing the latest web technologies such as Flexbox and Grid Layout for responsive design, the Local Storage API for data persistence, and the Three.js library for 3D model rendering.

The aim of the project is to enhance the Talespire experience by providing a convenient, easy-to-use tool that allows players to concentrate on the immersive storytelling and gameplay aspects of DND5e.

We welcome contributions and feedback as we continue to refine and expand the features of this character sheet, striving to create the ultimate resource for French-speaking Talespire players.
